## Summary

I estimate markups on lending rates and markdowns on deposit rates for all US depository institutions between 1992 and 2019.

The paper is made of two parts.
The first is methodological.
I borrow intuition from the production approach to the estimation of markups and I develop an econometric framework that suits banks.
This is important because banks are not the same as manufacturing firms.
Banks "produce" loans also subject to their balance sheet constraints.
It follows that deposits and equity are inputs, along with labor and physical capital.

In the second part, I move to the empirical results.
I show cross-sectional and time-series patterns for these new measures of market power at the bank level.

The time-series patterns are explained by profitability.
Banks seem to target a given level of profitability and they switch between using lending rates or deposit rates depending on aggregate economic conditions.

I compare markups and markdowns to the Herfindahl-Hirschman Indices and the Boone indicator.
There are significant differences.
I argue that markups and markdowns are better measures of market power.

HHIs are measures of market concentration within a given market.
They are sensitive to the definition of market, which is typically taken to be geography.
Markups and markdowns are not subject to this sensitivity.
Moreover, HHIs on loans and on deposits are very similar, while markups and markdowns allow to disentangle bank power on each market.
The Boone indicator instead assumes that marginal costs are taken as given, and therefore it cannot account for market power on input markets, meaning deposits.
Markups and markdowns instead allow for joint identification of the sources of market power.

Finally, I show that there is a small correlation between bank market power and bank default probabilities.
This contributes to the debated relationship between market power and financial stability in the banking industry.

A bonus is that you can use this bank-level evidence of markups and markdowns to calibrate a macroeconomic model with heterogenous banks.
This is the starting point for my future research.

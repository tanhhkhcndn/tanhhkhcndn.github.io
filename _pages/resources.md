This is a collection of notes on things I did.

- [A LaTeX Coverpage Template for Bocconi](../_posts/2019-09-18-bocconi-phd-thesis-coverpage-latex.md): an unofficial LaTeX coverpage for PhD theses at Bocconi University.
- [Build Your website](../_posts/2019-11-26-build-your-website.md): a small tutorial on how to get a website for online visibility.
- [How I Organize My Research](../_posts/2020-01-31-organize-your-research.md): a note on how I ended up using git to manage my research on my computer.

# Unofficial LaTeX Coverpage for PhD Theses at Bocconi

Bocconi requires PhD students to [submit their theses](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/phd/phd+in+economics+and+finance/info+for+current+students/phd+thesis+instructions+and+deadlines+ecofin) at some point (you know).
The thesis needs a coverpage and Bocconi offers a Microsoft Word document for it ([download](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/cb8e0180-a88d-41e6-873d-1f3d1243390b/Thesis+cover+template_ENG_july19.doc?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=mKjwLan)).
But I work in Economics and the leading writing tool here is LaTeX.
So I spent half a day coming up with a LaTeX alternative.

You can find the `.tex` file, as well as instructions on how to use it, at the [dedicated GitHub repository](https://github.com/apsql/phd_thesis_cover_bocconi).
There, you can also find a description of what I did and why.

This is how it looks.
